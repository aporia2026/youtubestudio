/**
 * Production-doc visual styles — both built-in and user-saved.
 *
 * A "style" used to be a single suffix string (cinematic, animation_2d, …)
 * appended verbatim to every AI image prompt. That's still here, but a
 * style now also carries:
 *
 *   - mixing_rules        — free-form instructions injected into the
 *                           system prompt that tell the model when to
 *                           mix AI-generated visuals with real stock
 *                           assets (logos, screenshots, photos)
 *   - allow_overlay_stock — when true, the model is allowed to populate
 *                           the per-row `overlay_stock_terms` field so
 *                           the editor composites a real asset on top
 *                           of the AI doodle in post
 *
 * Built-ins live in this file as constants. User-saved styles live in
 * the `production_doc_styles` table and are workspace-scoped. Callers
 * that want both should hit `listAllStyles(workspaceId)`.
 *
 * The legacy preset ids (cinematic, animation_2d, etc.) keep their
 * stable string ids so any old saved data — history entries, schedule
 * patches, persisted form state — keeps resolving correctly.
